    <h3>Clone the Repository</h3>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MPGranji/Rubik_Solver.git
cd Rubik_Solver
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed: - <strong>Python 3.x</strong>: Download from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. - A webcam connected to your computer. <h3>Install Dependencies</h3>
Install the required libraries:
bash

Thu g·ªçn

B·ªçc l·∫°i

Sao ch√©p
pip install opencv-python kociemba
(Optional) Use an IDE like <strong>PyCharm</strong> or <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> for a better development experience.

<h3>Run the Application</h3>
Launch the program:

bash

Sao ch√©p
python main.py
This opens the Frame window for scanning.

Scan the Cube:
Place a face of the Rubik's Cube in the webcam's scanning area.
Press the corresponding keys (or buttons if using a front-facing camera) to assign colors:
U (Up): White
D (Down): Yellow
L (Left): Orange
R (Right): Red
F (Front): Green
B (Back): Blue
Check the Preview window to ensure all faces are scanned correctly.
Solve the Cube:
Once all six faces are scanned, press Enter to view the solution in the Solution window.
Tips:
Ensure good lighting and camera focus for accurate color detection.
Verify the cube state in the Preview window before solving.

Cube Face Definitions
The solver uses standard Rubik's Cube notation with the following color assignments:

F (Front): Green
B (Back): Blue
U (Up): White
D (Down): Yellow
L (Left): Orange
R (Right): Red
Project Structure
main.py: Integrates scanning, state management, and solving logic.
cube_state.py: Manages the cube's state and rotations.
ui.py: Renders the Frame and Preview windows.

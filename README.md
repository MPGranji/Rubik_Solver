# Rubik_Solver

A Python-based Rubik's Cube solver using OpenCV for color detection and Kociemba's algorithm for generating solutions. This project provides a demo to scan a Rubik's Cube via webcam, detect its colors, and display a step-by-step solution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and webcam integration (`pip install opencv-python`)
- **Kociemba**: For solving the Rubik's Cube (`pip install kociemba`)

### Installation

1. Clone or download the source code from the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/MPGranji/Rubik_Solver.git
   cd Rubik_Solver
